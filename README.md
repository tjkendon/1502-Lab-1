# Lab 1 - Files and Arrays

Let's combine the skills we developed processing ArrayLists and apply them to processing arrays. 

_A file (“marks.txt”) has 1 line per student: student ID (String) and midterm mark, separated by a blank.  
Read the data from the file and calculate the average._

This repository contains code `Average0` which calculates the average for the class, we want to do more. 

**To complete this lab you will**
 * Code and test the problem solution using arrays where the file is read and the data is loaded into two 1-D arrays, a string array and a double array.  
 * Revise the solution to the problem as follows:  Write out 1 line per student with ID, mark, and either “above average”, “below average” or “average” as appropriate.  Code and test your solution.
